# AutomateAttendance

Small tool built with Selenium for my CS teacher that automatically creates a new column for the Google Sheets attendance with the date, saving time each day.

## Features
- Cross-browser
- Cross-platform
- One less thing to worry about during the day so you can focus on what actually matters
